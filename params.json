{"name":"Computer Graphics on the Web","tagline":"Computer Graphics on the Web is a Melbourne meetup for developers, designers, animators, and programmers interested in web-based interactive graphics.","body":"# Computer Graphics on the Web\r\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Computer-Graphics-on-the-Web/\r\n\r\nWe’re a bunch of programmers, designers, artists and animators who want to use the latest goodness such as WebGL, Node.js, Javascript and HTML5 to make eye-popping animations. The web has matured enough to support a great deal to allow real-time computer graphics running natively in the browser. Come and wean yourself off Flash and write stuff directly on the web. Meet like-minded graphics person who loves web technology. With the new tools, it’s waaaay easier than you think.\r\n\r\n## Next Meetup\r\nJoin us for two presentations on animations and code! (More details to come.) After that, food and drinks are there for you to mingle with!\r\n\r\n**Animation + Code**\r\n\r\nKristina Johnson, CSIRO\r\n\r\nAn overview of animated films and visualisations that I’ve created from scientific datasets. Projects covered will include Visualising a multidimensional Quantum Monte Carlo nodal surface in 3D space, Visualising multiple data streams from electronic animal tag sensors and ocean data products, Visualisation of Dynamic Electron Trajectories from Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and Visualisation of surface defects in Pt nanoparticles. The presentation will cover Maya, Python, Express, Cesium, Jade and D3.\r\n\r\n8th December 2015, 6:15pm for 6:30pm start.\r\n\r\n**Common Code**\r\n3067 - 8 Studley St\r\nAbbotsford VIC 3067\r\nAustralia\r\n\r\nMap: https://goo.gl/maps/YGHTDFVemU42\r\n\r\n## Elsewhere on the 'net\r\n * Meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Computer-Graphics-on-the-Web/\r\n\r\n## Sponsors\r\nWithout our sponsors this meetup wouldn't be possible.
