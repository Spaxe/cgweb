{"name":"Computer Graphics on the Web","tagline":"Computer Graphics on the Web is a Melbourne meetup for developers, designers, animators, and programmers interested in web-based interactive graphics.","body":"# Computer Graphics on the Web\r\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Computer-Graphics-on-the-Web/\r\n\r\nWe’re a bunch of programmers, designers, artists and animators who want to use the latest goodness such as WebGL, Node.js, Javascript and HTML5 to make eye-popping animations. The web has matured enough to support a great deal to allow real-time computer graphics running natively in the browser. Come and wean yourself off Flash and write stuff directly on the web. Meet like-minded graphics person who loves web technology. With the new tools, it’s waaaay easier than you think.\r\n\r\n## Next Meetup\r\n\r\n[RSVP Here!](http://www.meetup.com/Khronos-Melbourne-Chapter/events/228221875/)\r\nTwo speakers will talk about their works in information visualisation (Florence Wang) and stereoscopic virtual reality (Björn Sommer). Food and drinks are provided after the talks for you to nibble and converse.\r\n\r\n**Visual Analytics Medley**\r\n\r\nFlorence Wang, CSIRO\r\n\r\n“Visual analytics integrates the analytic capabilities of the computer and abilities of the human analyst, thus allowing novel discoveries and empowering individuals to take control of the analytical process.” — Mastering the Information Age Solving Problems with Visual Analytics\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Florence will take you through the journey of her understanding of visual analytics by presenting a few applications she has developed in the past, which includes a visualisation research work, “sentiCompass”, for exploring and comparing the sentiments of time varying twitter data; And then furthermore, a market research visual analytics application for analysing supermarket consumer navigation path using eye tracking devices.\r\n\r\n**Stereoscopic Virtual Reality on the Web**\r\n\r\nBjorn Sommer, Monash University/Konstanz University\r\n\r\nAfter the hype of Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) technologies around the year 2011, internationally initiated by the movie Avatar, now the next hype is about to start: Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) are promised to be the next revolution in consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nBut are HMDs really new? This talk will discuss a few historical facts concerning S3D which are often unknown to the public, as well as the basic technical knowledge about S3D visualization. We will give a short overview on full-immersive technologies – such as Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard – as well as semi-immersive ones, such as CAVEs and zSpace. Also, the way to present S3D movies in the Web with YouTube will be discussed.\r\n\r\nMany topics will be based on the 27th conference on Stereoscopic Displays and Applications which just finished a few weeks ago in San Francisco, and where our latest CELLmicrocosmos animation won the best of show award in the animation category.\r\n\r\nWhen: 1 March 2016, 6:15pm for 6:30pm start\r\n\r\nWhere: Common Code (https://goo.gl/maps/YGHTDFVemU42)\r\n\r\nDirections: Take the train from Parliament Station to Victoria Park or Collingwood Station and a short walk to venue.\r\n\r\nThe presentation format is 20 minutes + 10 minutes Q&A.\r\n\r\nComputer Graphics on the Web is kindly sponsored by Common Code for its excellent managers and event venue. Food and drinks are sponsored by the wonderful Khronos Group, the open standards body for WebGL and friends.\r\n\r\nWe hope to see you at the event!\r\n\r\n## Sponsors\r\nWithout our sponsors this meetup wouldn't be possible.
