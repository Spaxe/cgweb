# Computer Graphics on the Web
http://www.meetup.com/Computer-Graphics-on-the-Web/

We’re a bunch of programmers, designers, artists and animators who want to use the latest goodness such as WebGL, Node.js, Javascript and HTML5 to make eye-popping animations. The web has matured enough to support a great deal to allow real-time computer graphics running natively in the browser. Come and wean yourself off Flash and write stuff directly on the web. Meet like-minded graphics person who loves web technology. With the new tools, it’s waaaay easier than you think.
