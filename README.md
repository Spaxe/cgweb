# Computer Graphics on the Web
http://www.meetup.com/Computer-Graphics-on-the-Web/

We’re a bunch of programmers, designers, artists and animators who want to use the latest goodness such as WebGL, Node.js, Javascript and HTML5 to make eye-popping animations. The web has matured enough to support a great deal to allow real-time computer graphics running natively in the browser. Come and wean yourself off Flash and write stuff directly on the web. Meet like-minded graphics person who loves web technology. With the new tools, it’s waaaay easier than you think.

## Next Meetup
Join us for two presentations on animations and code! (More details to come.) After that, food and drinks are there for you to mingle with!

**Animation + Code**

Kristina Johnson, CSIRO

An overview of animated films and visualisations that I’ve created from scientific datasets. Projects covered will include Visualising a multidimensional Quantum Monte Carlo nodal surface in 3D space, Visualising multiple data streams from electronic animal tag sensors and ocean data products, Visualisation of Dynamic Electron Trajectories from Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and Visualisation of surface defects in Pt nanoparticles. The presentation will cover Maya, Python, Express, Cesium, Jade and D3.

8th December 2015, 6:15pm for 6:30pm start.
