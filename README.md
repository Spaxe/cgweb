# Computer Graphics on the Web
http://www.meetup.com/Computer-Graphics-on-the-Web/

We’re a bunch of programmers, designers, artists and animators who want to use the latest goodness such as WebGL, Node.js, Javascript and HTML5 to make eye-popping animations. The web has matured enough to support a great deal to allow real-time computer graphics running natively in the browser. Come and wean yourself off Flash and write stuff directly on the web. Meet like-minded graphics person who loves web technology. With the new tools, it’s waaaay easier than you think.

### We want you on mic in 2017!

You may recall responding to a "Yes/Maybe/No" question when signing up for this meetup.

Most of you said Maybe or No, but we do have a good 20-30 Yes'ers in the meetup. Unfortunately for us, Meetup doesn't provide emails to organisers, so we had no personal ways to contact you. Luckily, there is one—Meetup emails.

That said, if you would like to speak at Computer Graphics on the Web next year anytime, shoot Xavier a quick email at contact@xavierho.com. Even if you think your content is mildly interesting to the attendees here, please get in touch with us.

If you've never done public speaking before, or just want to improve your speaking skills, Computer Graphics on the Web is an inclusive learning space for you. We're also happy to provide mentoring for your presentation and honing your speaking skills.

In particular, we are looking for the following, but not exlusively:

 * Design Showcase - demo your work at CGWeb with 5-6 others
 * Animation Screening / port-mortems / making-of
 * WebGL 2.0 - looking ahead / general overview
 * Computer Graphics on the Web - literally!
 * Introductions to WebVR / A-Frame
 * Custom hardware / unique interactions
 * Virtual / Augmented / Mixed Reality
 * Computer Graphics in museums, films, and art
 * Workshop / Tutorials proposals - 3 hours
 * Design + Technology intersections / interventions
 * Art + Technology intersections / collaborations
 * Creative Coding and tinkering prototypes
 * Nerding out about computer graphics in depth

This meetup is made possible by speakers volunteering their time and venues giving us their space in-kind, and we're able to keep it free.

Simply send Xavier a short email at contact@xavierho.com, include a line or two about your presentation or work, and we'll work it out from there! :)

## Sponsors
Without our sponsors this meetup wouldn't be possible. [Common Code](http://commoncode.com.au/) for providing us an event space. [Khronos Melbourne Chapter](http://www.meetup.com/Khronos-Melbourne-Chapter/) for providing food and drinks.

We are still looking for sponsors for 2017. Please get in touch with Xavier if you're interested to help in any way!
